When contributing make sure that you're not doing anything harmful to the user experience or doing anything malicious behind the scenes. Try not to make your changes conflict with whatever changes I have made in this repository. Please understand that any changes I feel I need to reject will be rejected and you may not receive further information as to why. However, if I only need you to make small changes, I will make comments in your pull request so you can fix them as soon as possible!
